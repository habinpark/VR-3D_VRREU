#Create a 3D project


##Setup

![](images/create3dproject.jpg)

1. Open Unity Hub, click the New Project Button
1. Select the 3D template (circled on left)
2. Type a descriptive project name (top right circle)
3. IMPORTANT -- choose a location to save your project (bottom right circle). This should be on your computer's hard drive or an external hard drive. It should not be in iCloud or other networked drive where files are automatically loaded and unloaded onto your disk -- this will cause errors and unexpected behavior.
4. Click 'Create Project'
5. Your project will be created, added to Unity Hub, and opened in Unity

##Returning to your project
