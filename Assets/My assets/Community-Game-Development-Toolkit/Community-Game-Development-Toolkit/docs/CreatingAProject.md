# Creating a Project Using the Community Game Development Toolkit

1. Download the Community Game Development Toolkit Template Project [here](https://www.daniellichtman.com/toolkit-trial/download.html).
1. Unzip this file, and put the resulting folder somewhere on your hard-drive. This is where your project will be stored. If you use a Mac, make sure the folder is not stored in your iCloud files, or in a folder in which the computer manages disk space by uploading files to iCloud (this is mostly an issue on MacBook Airs with small harddrives).
1. Rename the folder -- this will be the name of your project. Ex: "First CGDT Project"
1. Open Unity Hub, and click 'Add' to add a project. Navigate to the folder you just named, and press ok to add this folder as a project.
1. The project will now appear in the Projects section of Unity Hub. Click it to open it in Unity.
